I helped build Biko.ng, a website where business owners can create and manage their online store without writing a single line of code and a fast growing startup in West-Africa. The process is kept simple and all setup can be done in less than 10mins. Biko.ng also takes vital steps to ensure that managing an online store can be done from any place and with little or no stress.
